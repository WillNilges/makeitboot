    <p>People seem to be confused about Linux. About what it is, how to install it, and how to use it. While there are many resources online about what Linux is and how to use it, there aren't that many simplified, specialized guides about how to install it that are approachable and user-friendly.
    <br><br>
    This is the site that will change that.
    <br><br>

    <p>Even if knowledge of Linux isn't the issue, installing it is usually percieved as difficult, but on many machines, it's not.
    <br><br>
    However, there are a fair few machines out there where the installation process requires extra steps. These extra steps can become quite technical and daunting to new users. These machines mostly consist of gaming machines and other kinds of computers with specialized features, such as the Microsoft Surface.
    <br><br>
    The reality is that, it's possible to install Linux on anything, and it just takes a few extra steps. This catalogue of guides aims to tackle those popular-yet-difficult machines and water down complicated wiki pages and forum chains to a set of simple, straightforward tasks.
