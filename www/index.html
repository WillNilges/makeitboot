    <p>People seem to be confused about Linux. About what it is, and how to use it. Resources can be found online explaining all about that fairly easily.</p>
    <ul id="centerlist">
        <li><a href=https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/>Overview of Linux</a></li>
        <li>of</li>
        <li>items</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Even if all that isn't an issue, installing it is usually percieved as difficult. On many machines, it's not.
    <br>
    However, there are a fair few machines out there where the installation process requires extra steps. These extra steps can be <em>highly</em> technical and daunting to new users. These machines mostly consist of gaming machines and other kinds of computers with specialized features, such as the Microsoft Surface.
    <br>
    The reality is that, it's possible to install Linux on anything, and it just takes a few extra steps. This catalogue of guides aims to tackle those popular-yet-difficult machines and water down complicated wiki pages and forum chains to a set of simple, straightforward tasks.
