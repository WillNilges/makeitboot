        The XPS 9560 is a solid machine used by many students, professionals, and enthusiasts alike. It is a solid Linux machine, provided its proprietary features can be wrangled.
    </p>
    <p>Many people have managed to get a wide variety of distros working on this machine, with varying levels of success. An experienced Linux user can deside for themself which of these to use in the long run.</p>
