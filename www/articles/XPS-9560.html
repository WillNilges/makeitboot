    <p>
        The XPS 9560 is a solid machine used by many students, professionals, and enthusiasts alike. It is a solid Linux machine, provided its proprietary features can be wrangled.
    </p>
    <p>Main Issues:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RAID Storage configuration</li>
        <li>Power Management</li>
        <li>nVidia GPUs</li>
        <li>Secure boot</li>
        <li>4K display</li>
        <li>Wireless</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many people have managed to get a wide variety of distros working on this machine, with varying levels of success. Experienced Linux users can deside for themselves which of these to use in the long run.</p>

    <p>For beginners, however, it seems that, due to its native support for GPUs, Pop!_OS is a good choice for people who want a "just works" Linux experience.</p>

    <p>Pop!_OS is a distro focused on ease of use. With a brilliant spin on the GNOME desktop environment and an impressive amount of effort put into things like power management and graphics switching technology, Pop!_OS works well on machines with uncooperative graphics systems and other bizarre technologies.</p>
