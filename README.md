Source code of my funky fresh new linux booting site

## Page contents

There will be a set of instructions for at least one known working distro, probably in increasing difficulty. For example, Pop!\_OS works really nicely with a lot of systems, but there's not a ton of hands on DIY config to do with that, so more adventerous users might want to use Arch or something and so there should be a guide for that.

This guide focuses on methods and techniques I know to get machines working, and not catching on fire! I'm never going to say there's one way to do something, and this is going to be a guide we write together.
